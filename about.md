# A Little About Daycho (Me!) ♪(´▽｀)

Starting a new season as a college student, with all the lessons learned from previous episodes. Continuity is key! I aspire to fully master American English, figure out what degree to declare, and do my absolute best this semester! This is my first time taking a proper design course, so I'm very excited for what's to come.

## ☆ My Hobbies ☆
Drawing is my longest and most enjoyable hobby. It's my dearest endeavor, though that makes it much more than a simple hobby. Other hobbies I dabble in are playing piano, story-based video games, hiking, reading (I need to do more of that), and cooking. I do want to add more to this list eventually.
